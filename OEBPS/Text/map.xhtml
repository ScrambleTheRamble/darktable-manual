</div>

<p>Map view will show you a world map with the currently open image, or film roll of images, pinned to their geotagged location. This requires that the image was geotagged by a camera with that feature. Some newer cameras, including smartphones, are already equipped with GPS receivers. Other cameras may need additional GPS hardware to do this.</p>
<p>Even if your camera doesn't support this feature, there is an alternative method. darktable can match the Exif time and date data in your image(s) to a separate GPX data tracking file created by a GPS tracker recording your movements. These can be handheld devices or a GPS tracker app on your smartphone. This is all done in the lighttable view (see <a title="2.3.9. Geotagging" href="../Text/lighttable.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_154">Section 2.3.9, “Geotagging”</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>Map data are taken from open map sources on the internet. New map data are only available if you are connected to the internet. darktable keeps a disk cache of previously loaded map data.</p>
<p>Your mouse will allow navigation in the map. Left-click will drag the map; using the scroll-wheel will zoom in or out.</p>
<p>There are on-screen controls and displays that assist you to find your way. A navigation area is located on top left of the map. Use it as an alternative to mouse-dragging and scrolling. The scale of your map is displayed on bottom left. On bottom right you see the geographical coordinates for the center of the map.</p>
<p>Images that already have geo location attributes in their metadata are displayed as small icons on the map.</p>
<p>In order to assign geo coordinates to an image, activate the film-strip on the lower panel (press <span><em>Ctrl-f</em></span>). You can simply assign a geo location to an image by dragging the image icon from the film-strip and position it onto the map. darktable will record the new geo location (longitude and latitude) as part of the image metadata. Exported images will include this data.</p>
<p>In order to remove geo coordinates from an image just drag it from the map and drop it onto the filmstrip.</p>
<p>Left and right to the central map there are panels for additional control.</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_708">5.1.2. Undo/redo</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>All image moves in the map view are recorded by darktable. It is then possible to undo or redo such changes to recover a previous state. Note that this undo/redo facility is unlimited while moving images but it is reset each time the map view is left.</p>
<p>The default key shortcuts are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><em>Ctrl-z</em></span> : undo last move</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><em>Ctrl-y</em></span> : redo last undo (does nothing if undo has not been used yet)</p>
