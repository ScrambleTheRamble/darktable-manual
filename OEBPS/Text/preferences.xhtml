<h1>Chapter 8. Preferences and settings<br/></h1>
<div>darktable comes with a number of settings that can be configured by users. You reach the configuration menu by clicking&nbsp;<img alt="darkroom_preferences" src="../Images/darkroom_preferences.jpg" width="2%"/>&nbsp;at the top of the screen.</div>
<div><img alt="preferences_view" src="../Images/preferences_view.jpg" class="center"/><br/></div>
<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_86">8.1. GUI options<br/></h2>
<p>These options control the look and feel of darktable.</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_737">width of the side panels in pixels</h5>
<p>This controls the size of side panels in pixels. Side panels are found left and right to the center view (default 350).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_738">don't use embedded preview JPEG but half-size raw</h5>
<p>Check this option to not use the embedded JPEG from the raw file but process the raw data. This is slower. (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_739">ask before removing images from database</h5>
<p>Always ask the user before any image is removed from the database (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_740">ask before erasing images from disk</h5>
<p>Always ask the user before any image file is deleted (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_741">send files to trash when erasing images</h5>
<p>Instead of physically deleting images from disk put them into the system's trash bin (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_742">ask before moving images from film roll folder</h5>
<p>Always ask the user before any image file is moved (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_743">ask before copying images to new film roll folder</h5>
<p>Always ask the user before any image file is copied (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_744">number of folder levels to show in lists</h5>
<p>The number of folder levels to show in film roll names, starting from the right (default 1).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_745">ignore JPEG images when importing film rolls</h5>
<p>When having RAW+JPEG images together in one directory it makes no sense to import both. With this flag one can ignore all JPEGs found (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_746">recursive directory traversal when importing film rolls</h5>
<p>Not only import images from the directory selected but recursively go through all subdirectories as well (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_747">creator to be applied when importing</h5>
<p>If provided, automatically add this string as a creator tag when importing images (default none).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_748">publisher to be applied when importing</h5>
<p>If provided, automatically add this string as a publisher tag when importing images (default none).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_749">rights to be applied when importing</h5>
<p>If provided, automatically add this string as a copyrights tag when importing images (default none).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_750">comma separated tags to be applied when importing</h5>
<p>If you want to add further tags when importing images, you can give them as a comma separated list (default none).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_751">initial import rating</h5>
<p>Initial star rating (from 0 to 5) for all images when importing a film roll (default 1).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_752">enable filmstrip</h5>
<p>Enable the filmstrip in darkroom, tethering and geomapping modes (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_753">high quality thumb processing from size</h5>
<p>If the thumbnails size is greater than this value, it will be processed using the full quality rendering path which is better but slower (default 720p).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_754">pen pressure control for brush masks</h5>
<p>Controls how the pressure reading of a graphics tablet impacts newly generated brush strokes (see&nbsp;<a title="3.2.7. Drawn mask" href="../Text/darkroom.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_194">Section 3.2.7, “Drawn mask”</a>). You can control the brush width, its hardness and its opacity. <span>“<span>Absolute</span>”</span> control means that the pressure reading directly defines the attribute with a value between 0% and 100%. <span>“<span>Relative</span>”</span> means that the pressure reading adjusts the attribute between zero and the pre-defined default value (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_755">smoothing of brush strokes</h5>
<p>Sets the level for smoothing of brush strokes. Stronger smoothing leads to less nodes and easier editing at the expense of lower accuracy.</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_756">display of individual color channels</h5>
<p>Controls how individual color channels are displayed when activated in the parametric masks feature. You can choose between <span>“<span>false color</span>”</span> and <span>“<span>grey scale</span>”</span>(default false color).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_757">ask before deleting a tag</h5>
<p>Always ask user before deleting a tag from an image (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_758">only draw images on map that are currently collected and filtered</h5>
<p>Use the current filter settings to select the geotagged images drawn in the map view. This limits the images drawn to those currently shown in the filmstrip and thus reduces the time needed (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_759">maximum number of images drawn on map</h5>
<p>The maximum number of geotagged images drawn on the map. Increasing this number can slow down the drawing of the map. Needs a restart if changed (default 100).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_760">pretty print the image location</h5>
<p>Show a more readable representation of the geo location in the image information module (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_761">overlay txt sidecar over zoomed images</h5>
<p>When there is a text file next to an image it can be shown as an overlay over zoomed images on the lighttable. The text file has the same base name as the image file with file extension <span>“<span>.txt</span>”</span>. It either has to be there at import time or the crawler has to be enabled – see option <span>“<span>look for updated xmp files on startup</span>”</span> in <a title="8.2. Core options" href="#sigil_toc_id_5">Section 8.2, “Core options”</a> (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_762">expand a single lighttable module at a time</h5>
<p>Controls how lighttable panels are expanded. If this option is enabled, expanding a panel by <span><em>clicking</em></span> collapses any currently expanded panel. If you want to expand a panel without collapsing the others you do so with <span><em>shift-click</em></span>. Disabling this option reverts the meaning of <span><em>click</em></span> and <span><em>shift-click</em></span> (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_763">expand a single darkroom module at a time</h5>
<p>Controls how darkroom modules are expanded. If this option is enabled, expanding a module by <span><em>clicking</em></span> collapses any currently expanded module. If you want to expand a module without collapsing the others you do so with <span><em>shift-click</em></span>. Disabling this option reverts the meaning of <span><em>click</em></span> and <span><em>shift-click</em></span> (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_764">scroll to lighttable modules when expanded/collapsed</h5>
<p>With this option enabled the lighttable side panels will scroll a module to the top when it is expanded or collapsed (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_765">scroll to darkroom modules when expanded/collapsed</h5>
<p>With this option enabled the darkroom side panel will scroll a module to the top when it is expanded or collapsed (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_766">border around image in darkroom mode</h5>
<p>Process the image in darkroom mode with a small border of the given number of pixels (default 20).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_767">do high quality processing for slideshow</h5>
<p>Controls how images are processed for the slideshow view. It this option is enabled, the image will first be processed in full resolution, and downscaled at the very end. This can result in better quality sometimes, but will always be slower (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_768">rating an image one star twice will not zero out the rating</h5>
<p>Normally clicking a one star rating twice will set a zero star rating to that image. When checking this option a second click on a one star rating will keep that rating (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_769">method to use for getting the display profile</h5>
<p>This option allows to force a specific way of getting the current display profile for color management (see <a title="3.2.10.2. Rendering method" href="../Text/darkroom.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_260">Section 3.2.10.2, “Rendering method”</a>). In the default setting<span>“<span>all</span>”</span> darktable will either query the X display server's xatom or the <span><em>colord</em></span> system service. You can set this option to <span>“<span>xatom</span>”</span> or <span>“<span>colord</span>”</span> to enforce a specific method if the alternative gives wrong results.</p>
<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_5">8.2. Core options<br/></h2>
<p>These options control some of the internals of darktable.</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_770">memory in megabytes to use for thumbnail cache</h5>
<p>In order to speed-up display of film rolls, darktable stores thumbnails in a cache file on disk (primary cache) and loads it into memory at startup. This value controls the cache size in megabytes. It needs a restart if changed (default 256MB).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_771">enable disk backend for thumbnail cache</h5>
<p>If activated darktable stores all thumbnails on disk as a secondary cache, and thereby keeping thumbnails accessible in case they get dropped from the primary cache. This needs more disk space but speeds up lighttable view as it avoids reprocessing of thumbnails (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_772">color manage cached thumbnails</h5>
<p>If activated darktable generates thumbnails in a general color space (AdobeRGB) in order to render them independently of the individual monitor. Conversion to the monitor color space is done at display time. If this option is not activated thumbnails are directly stored in the specific monitor color space valid at generation time and are subsequently displayed without further corrections (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_773">number of background threads</h5>
<p>This controls how many parallel threads are used to create thumbnails during import. On 32bit systems it is strongly recommended to set this to 1. Needs a restart if changed (default 2).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_774">host memory limit (in MB) for tiling</h5>
<p>In order to manage large images on systems with limited memory darktable does tile-wise processing. This variable controls the <span><em>maximum</em></span> amount of memory (in MB) a module may use during image processing. Lower values will force memory hungry modules to process an image with increasing number of tiles. Setting this to 0 will omit any limits. Values below 500 will be treated as 500. On a 32bit system you should set this to 500. Needs a restart if changed (default 1500).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_775">minimum amount of memory (in MB) for a single buffer in tiling</h5>
<p>If set to a positive, non-zero value, this variable defines the <span><em>minimum</em></span> amount of memory (in MB) that darktable should take for a single tile. On a 32bit system you should set this to 8. 64bit systems can live with higher values. Needs a restart if changed (default 16).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_776">write sidecar file for each image</h5>
<p>These redundant XMP files can later be re-imported into a different database, preserving your changes to the image. It's strongly recommended to have this option activated so you don't lose data in case of a database corruption. Backing up your raw file plus the accompanying XMP file will allow you to fully restore your work (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_777">store xmp tags in compressed format</h5>
<p>Entries in XMP tags can get rather large and may exceed the available space to store the history stack in output files on export. This option allows binary XMP tags to be compressed in order to save space. Available options are <span>“<span>never</span>”</span>, <span>“<span>always</span>”</span>, and <span>“<span>only large entries</span>”</span> (default).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_778">omit hierarchy in simple tag lists</h5>
<p>When exporting images the hierarchical tags are also added as a simple list of non-hierarchical ones to make them visible to some other programs. When this option is checked darktable will only include their last part and ignore the rest. So<span>“<span>foo|bar|baz</span>”</span> will only add <span>“<span>baz</span>”</span>.</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_779">activate OpenCL support</h5>
<p>darktable can use your GPU to speed up processing significantly. Interface OpenCL requires suitable hardware and matching OpenCL drivers on your system. If one of those is not found the option is greyed out. Can be switched on and off at any time and takes immediate effect (default on).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_780">OpenCL scheduling profile</h5>
<p>Defines how preview and full pixelpipe tasks are scheduled on OpenCL enabled systems. <span>“<span>default</span>”</span>: the GPU processes the center view pixelpipe and the CPU processes the preview pipe; <span>“<span>multiple GPUs</span>”</span>: both pixelpipes are processed in parallel on two different GPUs; <span>“<span>very fast GPU</span>”</span>: both pixelipes are processed sequentially on the GPU.</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_781">always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile</h5>
<p>If this option is activated, darktable will use system library LittleCMS 2 instead of its own routines. This is significantly slower than the default but might give more accurate results in some cases (default off).</p>
<p>Note that if the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both, a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this configuration parameter's value.</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_782">do high quality resampling during export</h5>
<p>The image will first be processed in full resolution, and downscaled at the very end. This can result in better quality sometimes, but will always be slower (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_783">demosaicing for zoomed out darkroom mode</h5>
<p>Interpolation when not viewing 1:1 in darkroom mode: <span>“<span>always bilinear (fast)</span>”</span> is fastest, but not as sharp. <span>“<span>at most ppg (reasonable)</span>”</span> is using ppg + interpolation modes specified below, <span>“<span>full (possibly slow)</span>”</span> will use exactly the settings for full-size export (default <span>“<span>at most ppg (reasonable)</span>”</span>).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_784">pixel interpolator</h5>
<p>Pixel interpolator used in rotation, lens correction, up-and-down scaling; options are<span>“<span>bilinear</span>”</span>, <span>“<span>bicubic</span>”</span>, <span>“<span>lanczos2</span>”</span>, <span>“<span>lanczos3</span>”</span> (default).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_785">password storage backend to use</h5>
<p>The storage backend for password storage. Options: <span>“<span>auto</span>”</span> (default), <span>“<span>none</span>”</span>, <span>“<span>libsecret</span>”</span>, <span>“<span>kwallet</span>”</span>.</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_786">look for updated xmp files on startup</h5>
<p>Check file modification times of all XMP files on startup to find out if any got updated in the meantime by some other software. If updated XMP files are found a menu opens for the user to decide which of the XMP files to be reloaded – replacing darktable's database entries by the XMP file contents – and which of the XMP files to be overwritten by darktable's database. Activating this option also causes darktable to check for text sidecar files that have been added after import time – see option<span>“<span>overlay txt sidecar over zoomed images</span>”</span> in <a title="8.1. GUI options" href="#sigil_toc_id_86">Section 8.1, “GUI options”</a> (default off).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_787">executable for playing audio files</h5>
<p>Defines an external program which is used in the lighttable view to play audio files that some cameras record to keep notes for images (default <span>“<span>aplay</span>”</span>).</p>
<h5 id="sigil_toc_id_788">auto-apply per camera basecurve presets</h5>
<p>Use the per-camera basecurve by default instead of the generic manufacturer one if there is one available. For more details see <a title="3.4.1.4. Base curve" href="../Text/darkroom.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_186">Section 3.4.1.4, “Base curve”</a> (default off).</p>
<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_107">8.3. Session options<br/></h2>
<p>These options define a naming pattern to organize images on disk when importing from a connected camera (see <a title="2.3.1. Import" href="../Text/lighttable.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_26">Section 2.3.1, “Import”</a>) and when taking photos in the tethering view (see <a title="Chapter 4. Tethering" href="../Text/tethering.xhtml">Chapter 4, <em>Tethering</em></a>).</p>
<p>The naming pattern consists of three parts: a base part defining the parent folder, a session part defining a sub directory which is specific to the individual import session, and a file name part defining the filename structure for each imported image.</p>
<p>Several pre-defined variables can be used in the pattern as placeholders:</p>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_197">8.5. Presets<br/></h2>
<p>This menu gives you an overview of the presets that are defined for darktable's modules. In this dialog you can select whether a certain user defined preset shall be auto-applied to matching images.</p>
<p>darktable already comes with a set of pre-defined presets for several modules. In addition you can define your own presets from within each module in darkroom mode (see <a title="3.2.3. Module presets" href="../Text/darkroom.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_193">Section 3.2.3, “Module presets”</a>).</p>
<p>Pre-defined presets are shown with a lock symbol. Their auto-apply properties can not be changed.</p>
<p>Double clicking on a user-defined preset will open a menu.</p>
