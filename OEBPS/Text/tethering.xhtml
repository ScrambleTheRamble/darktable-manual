<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_694">4.1. Overview</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To use the tethering feature you need to connect your camera to your PC using a USB cable. Your computer might ask to mount or view the connected camera. Do not mount or view the camera. If that happens automatically, you will need to <span>“<span>unmount/eject</span>”</span> the camera. This is required to unlock the camera so darktable can lock it for usage.</p>
<p>After the USB cable is connected, look at the import panel in lighttable mode (see&nbsp;<a title="2.3.1. Import" href="../Text/lighttable.xhtml#sigil_toc_id_26">Section 2.3.1, “Import”</a>). If your camera is not visible in this panel, click the <span>“<span>scan devices</span>”</span> button and it will appear with two functions: <span>“<span>import from camera</span>”</span> and <span>“<span>tethered shoot</span>”</span>. Click <span>“<span>tethered shoot</span>”</span> to enter the tethering mode.</p>
<p>darktable uses gphoto2 to interface with your camera. If you have problems finding the connected camera as described above, check the troubleshoot section in this chapter in order to verify your camera has tethering support.</p>

<p>When entering tethering view, a film roll will be created using the same structure as defined when you import from the camera. Job code will be predefined as <span>“<span>capture</span>”</span>.</p>
<p>If you want to group your captures into different film rolls, you should use the session panel in right side. When entering a new name and pressing enter, a new film roll will be created and captured images will go into this new film roll.</p>
<p>darktable provides some nifty tools to setup a capture in the user interface. You can setup timelapse captures and brackets for HDR creations. The configuration is so dynamic that you can create sequential capture of brackets – go figure... For more information read the documentation about the capture panel and the examples in this chapter.</p>

<p>A session is a sequence of exposures taken in tethering mode and going into a single film roll. A new session equals a new film roll. A film roll is created with the same storage structure that is used when you import images from camera into darktable.</p>
<p>It's a bit awkward, but configuring this storage structure is done in the camera import dialog for now.</p>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_700">4.3. Examples</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This section contains examples of typical usages of tethering.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_701"><a name="tethering_examples_studio"></a>4.3.1. Studio setup with screening</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a pretty common use case. You have your studio and subject set up, the camera is connected to your computer and tethering view is active in darktable. You work at the camera and take images. Whenever you want, you can screen the image directly on your computer monitor instead of using the camera LCD for validation.</p>
<p>This workflow is efficient and effective, since you can immediately review your captures instead of waiting until after the shoot when everyone is gone. If you're shooting a model this is a pretty nice way to pre-view the captures with the client instead of fumbling around with your camera.</p>
<p>Working in the tethered mode can save you time and aggravation. Set a session name, shoot your images and they will save in the correct film roll for the session for easy on-site review.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_702">4.3.2. Capturing a timelapse</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A timelapse is a video clip composed of images taken in a time sequence. A typical example is to take a timelapse of cityscapes where you capture clouds and traffic etc.</p>
<p>To setup a timelapse capture, create a new session as described previously. Now decide if you want to shoot in manual or auto mode. Only use auto in situations were the ambient light will change significantly during the time of the shoot, eg. shooting a timelapse over 24 hours might give you easier control of light in that kind of captured sequence.</p>
<p>The camera settings panel is where you define delay and sequence. Sequence will give you the opportunity to choose how many images you want to capture and delay will set the time in seconds between captures.</p>
<p>To start the capture click the capture button in the same panel and watch the filmstrip fill up with images. The latest captured image is always displayed in center view.</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_704"><a name="tethering_troubleshoot_supported"></a>4.4.1. Verify that your camera is supported</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This troubleshooting guide will give you steps to verify your camera can be used with tethering. This is done using the gphoto2 commandline tools. This is what darktable uses to interface with your camera.</p>
<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Verify that camera is detected</p>
<p>The following command will verify a camera that is connected to the computer and detected by gphoto2. Find your camera port name to use it in the following tests below. Usually port <span>“<span>usb:</span>”</span> will be enough and therefore used in these examples.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>env LANG=C gphoto2 --auto-detect
</pre>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify camera driver abilities</p>
<p>Execute the following command and verify that the <span><em>capture choices</em></span> ability supports <span>“<span>Image</span>”</span> and <span><em>configuration support</em></span> is <span>“<span>yes</span>”</span>. darktable will check these two abilities and decide if <span>“<span>tethered shoot</span>”</span> button should be shown or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>env LANG=C gphoto2 --port usb: --abilities
</pre>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify camera remote capture</p>
<p>This step will verify that your camera can be remotely controlled; that it can capture an image, download it to your computer and display it within darktable.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>env LANG=C gphoto2 --port usb: --capture-image-and-download
</pre>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify camera tethered capture</p>
<p>And this last step tests if your camera supports events which darktable heavily relies on. Running this command will make the gphoto2 process wait for an image capture event which you must manually trigger on your camera. If successful, the image will be downloaded to your computer.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>env LANG=C gphoto2 --port usb: --capture-tethered</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_705">4.4.2. So, now what?</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If any of the steps above failed, there are problems with your specific camera and driver. Please report the issues to gphoto2 mailing list for further help. You can find the mailing list at <a href="http://www.gphoto.org/mailinglists/" target="_top">www.gphoto.org</a>. Add the following flags to the failed command above for better support and attach the log output to your mail:</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>--debug --debug-file gphoto2_debug.log
</pre>
<p> </p>
<p>If you successfully went through all the tests above, your camera will most likely be supported by darktable. Even if successful, if you stumble upon a problem in darktable, please file a bug at <a href="https://www.darktable.org/redmine" target="_top">redmine</a>. Please attach the log outputs from the steps above and the log file output generated after starting darktable with the following command.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>darktable -d camctl 2&gt;1 &gt;camctl.log</pre>
